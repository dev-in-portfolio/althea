BLUEPRINT: Room Key (Firebase Auth + Neon DB, multi-user “rooms”)

What it is

Create “rooms” (shared spaces), invite others via invite code, store items inside. This is the best hybrid demo for permissions + relational joins.

Stack

Next.js + TS

Firebase Auth (Anonymous or upgraded later)

Firebase Admin token verification (server)

Neon Postgres (rooms, membership, items)


Roles

owner

member


Pages

/ — list rooms + create room

/room/[id] — room items, add item

/join — enter invite code to join


API

POST /api/rooms → create room (owner=uid)

GET /api/rooms → list rooms for uid

POST /api/rooms/join → join by invite code

GET /api/rooms/[id] → room detail (must be member)

POST /api/rooms/[id]/items → add item (member ok)

PATCH /api/items/[id] → edit (member ok)

DELETE /api/items/[id] → delete (owner-only or member-only; pick one)


Neon schema

sql/001_init.sql

create extension if not exists pgcrypto;

create table if not exists users (
  uid text primary key,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create table if not exists rooms (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  owner_uid text not null references users(uid) on delete cascade,
  name text not null,
  invite_code text not null unique,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create table if not exists room_members (
  room_id uuid not null references rooms(id) on delete cascade,
  uid text not null references users(uid) on delete cascade,
  role text not null check (role in ('owner','member')),
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key(room_id, uid)
);

create table if not exists room_items (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  room_id uuid not null references rooms(id) on delete cascade,
  created_by_uid text not null references users(uid) on delete cascade,
  title text not null,
  body text not null default '',
  status text not null default 'open' check (status in ('open','done')),
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create index if not exists idx_room_members_uid on room_members(uid);
create index if not exists idx_room_items_room_time on room_items(room_id, created_at desc);

Invite code generation

Server generates invite_code as a short, URL-safe string (e.g., 10 chars)

Must be unique (retry on conflict)

Keep it boring: random bytes → base32/hex trimmed


Permission checks (server)

Every room-scoped endpoint:

1. verify Firebase token → uid


2. check membership:



select role from room_members where room_id=$1 and uid=$2

3. enforce:



create room: anyone signed in

join room: anyone signed in with valid code

add/edit items: must be member

delete: either owner-only (recommended) or creator-only—choose and enforce consistently

Smoke test

1. User A creates room → gets invite code


2. User B joins with code


3. Both see room in list


4. B adds item, A sees it


5. A deletes item (owner privilege) and B sees it removed



Done definition

Done = verified auth, membership permissions enforced, room sharing works, Neon data model supports real collaboration.
