Exhibit Forge — Django + Neon blueprint (curated exhibit builder + publishable collections)

What it is

Exhibit Forge is a web app for building curated “exhibits” made of ordered cards (text, image, embed, quote), bundling them into collections, and publishing them as shareable, read-only public pages. This is not micro-logging — it’s a content product builder: editorial flow, ordering, publishing states, and public/private access.


---

Shared backbone (required in every Neon-backed Django app)

Flow: Browser → Django app → Neon Postgres

Identity

Django auth for creators

Public pages are read-only and do not require login


Server invariants

Django pinned version

ORM-first design

Env-based secrets only

No extra logging/telemetry



---

Stack

Django

Neon Postgres

Media uploads: local dev storage; configurable for production

Optional: Pillow for image handling (only if you want thumbnails)



---

Core objects

Exhibit: a curated narrative page

Card: a building block inside an exhibit (ordered)

Collection: a group of exhibits

Publish token: stable share slug for public viewing



---

Data model

Exhibit

user (FK)

title

slug (unique per user)

summary

status: draft | published

published_slug (global unique, used for public URL)

created_at, updated_at, published_at


ExhibitCard

exhibit (FK)

type: text | image | embed | quote

order (int)

title (optional)

body (text)

image (file path optional)

embed_url (optional)


Collection

user (FK)

name

description


CollectionItem

collection (FK)

exhibit (FK)

order (int)



---

Constraints + indexes (Neon)

Unique: (user_id, slug)

Unique: published_slug

Index: exhibit_id, order

Index: (user_id, status, updated_at desc)



---

Key flows (MVP)

Creator (authenticated)

/ dashboard: drafts + published

/exhibits/new

/exhibits/<id>/edit

add cards

reorder cards (up/down buttons; drag later)

preview mode


/collections/

group exhibits into collections

order exhibits



Public (no login)

/p/<published_slug>/ public exhibit page

/c/<collection_slug>/ public collection listing (optional v1)



---

Publishing rules (boring + strict)

Only exhibit owner can publish

Publish generates published_slug once and keeps it stable unless explicitly regenerated

Draft edits do not automatically change public version unless “Republish” action is used (choose one):

Option A (simplest): public always reflects latest saved state once published

Option B (stronger product): public reflects last published snapshot; republish required
Pick Option A for MVP unless you want snapshot complexity.




---

Admin features (must include)

Admin list filters: status, user

Inline card editing

Bulk publish/unpublish for admin (superusers only)



---

Smoke tests

1. Create user, login


2. Create exhibit “Crystal Hall”


3. Add 5 cards (text/image/embed)


4. Reorder cards and verify order persists


5. Publish exhibit → public URL works without login


6. Create a collection and add exhibit to it




---

Why it’s portfolio-strong

editorial content modeling

ordered components

publish states + public/private routing

media handling

clean Django architecture



---

Done definition

Done = creators can build ordered exhibits, publish them, and share a public read-only URL backed by Neon with correct access boundaries.
