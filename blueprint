Eleventy SpecForge — 11ty static “spec compiler” (YAML → docs) with schema checks + generated tables

What it is

SpecForge is a static site generator for project specs: you write a structured YAML spec (inputs/outputs/routes/db tables/constraints), and Eleventy compiles it into clean documentation pages with generated tables and cross-links. This is not a link directory (Switchboard) and not a patch vault (PatchBook). It’s structured spec → readable docs.

Stack (boring + stable)

Eleventy pinned

Node 20 compatible

Minimal dependencies:

YAML parser (pinned) if needed

otherwise use JSON instead of YAML (but this app’s point is YAML)



No backend.

Authoring model (source of truth)

Each spec is a YAML file:

src/specs/micro-exhibits.yaml

id: micro-exhibits
title: Micro-Exhibits
owner: devin
status: active
tags: [astro, neon, museum]

overview: >
  Exhibit browser with halls, search, favorites, and recent views.

entities:
  - name: favorites
    fields:
      - { name: user_key, type: text, pk: true }
      - { name: exhibit_slug, type: text, pk: true }
      - { name: created_at, type: timestamptz, default: now() }

routes:
  - method: GET
    path: /api/favorites
    request: { user_key: text }
    response: { favorites: array }

constraints:
  - "No secrets in repo"
  - "Server-only DB access"
  - "URL state for filters"

acceptance:
  - "Favorites persist"
  - "Search index excludes bodies"

Required fields

id unique

title

overview

at least one of: entities or routes

constraints[]

acceptance[]



---

Build-time validation (hard fail)

Fail build if:

missing required fields

duplicate id

route entries missing method/path

entity fields missing name/type

acceptance empty


Also generate a build report:

spec count

entities count

routes count

validation errors list



---

Generated pages

/ specs dashboard (search + tags + status)

/specs/ list

/specs/:id/ detail page:

Overview

Entities table

Routes table

Constraints checklist

Acceptance criteria checklist



Cross-links:

Tag hubs /tags/:tag/

Status hubs /status/:status/



---

Search index

Build /_spec_index.json with:

id

title

tags

status

excerpt from overview (No full YAML in index)


Client-side search + filters:

q, tag, status

Smoke tests

1. Add 2 YAML specs → build passes


2. Spec detail page shows entities + routes tables


3. Search finds spec by title/tag


4. Remove acceptance section → build fails


5. Tag hub lists correct specs
