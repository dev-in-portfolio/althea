Electron ReceiptBox — Electron app blueprint (local “receipts” vault for screenshots/logs/diffs)

What it is

ReceiptBox is a desktop vault that ingests “proof artifacts” (screenshots, logs, exported zips, diffs) and organizes them into cases with tags, timeline, and quick export bundles. This is not an orchestrator (Dockyard) and not Git cockpit — it’s artifact capture + packaging.

You’ll use it whenever you want:

“here’s exactly what happened”

“here are the logs + screenshot + diff”

“bundle this into a zip for review”

Core capabilities (MVP)

1) Case folders

Create a “case”:

title

project

tags

date range (auto)


Each case contains entries:

screenshot

log file

text note

diff/patch file

zip artifact


2) Fast ingest

Add artifacts by:

drag/drop file into the app

“watch folder” (optional)

paste image from clipboard (screenshot paste)


Store a copy into the case folder and keep original path reference.

3) Metadata + tagging

Each entry stores:

type

tags

notes

captured_at

hash (sha256) for dedupe


4) Export bundles

Select a case → export bundle:

creates a zip with:

/artifacts/*

MANIFEST.json

README.md summary


Optional “redaction mode” (later)

Architecture

Electron main process

file ingest + copying

hashing

zip bundling

watch folder support (optional)


Renderer UI

case list

case detail

artifact preview panes



---

Storage (local)

Folder structure:

~/ReceiptBox/
  cases/
    2026-02-26__netlify-build-fail__micro-exhibits/
      artifacts/
        001_screenshot.png
        002_buildlog.txt
        003_patch.diff
      manifest.json
      notes.md
  config.json

SQLite (optional) OR JSON index (MVP: SQLite is cleaner for queries) Tables if SQLite:

cases

artifacts

tags



---

Manifest schema (export)

MANIFEST.json

{
  "case": { "title": "...", "project": "...", "created_at": "..." },
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "filename": "001_screenshot.png",
      "type": "image",
      "sha256": "...",
      "captured_at": "...",
      "tags": ["netlify","deploy"],
      "notes": "..."
    }
  ]
}


---

UI layout (MVP)

Left: cases list + search

Middle: artifacts list for selected case

Right: preview (image/text) + metadata editor

Top: export bundle button



---

Dedupe rules

compute sha256

if same hash already exists in same case, prompt “skip/keep both”



---

Smoke tests

1. Create case


2. Drop 3 files (png/log/diff)


3. Preview each file


4. Add tags + notes


5. Export zip includes manifest + artifacts




---

Done definition

Done = ReceiptBox ingests artifacts into cases, dedupes by hash, previews them, and exports a clean zip bundle with manifest.
