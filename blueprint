Atlas Gallery — Django + Neon blueprint (image collections with tags + filters)

What it is

Atlas Gallery is a private, high-polish gallery backend + web app: upload images, organize into collections, tag them, and browse with filters/search. This is not “logging small things”—it’s a real content library you’d actually use, and it’s a strong Django showcase: models, admin, uploads, permissions, and query performance.


---

Shared backbone (required in every Neon-backed Django app)

Rule: Clients never connect to Neon directly.
Flow: Browser/Client → Django app → Neon (Postgres)

Identity (v1, simple & real)

Use Django authentication (email+password) so permissions are clean and Django-native.

Neon hosts Postgres; Django uses DATABASE_URL (or explicit DB env vars).

Secrets only in env; .env.example uses REDACTED placeholders.


Server invariants

Django pinned (stable)

Parameterized ORM queries only

No secret commits

Basic request size limits for uploads



---

Stack

Django (pinned)

Postgres (Neon)

Storage: local disk in dev; configurable for prod (still works without S3)

Optional (only if you want): Pillow for image metadata/thumbnails



---

Data model

Core models

Collection (owner, name)

Asset (image file, collection, caption, created_at)

Tag (owner, name)

AssetTag (m2m)

Optional: Favorite (user ↔ asset)


Schema sketch

Collection: user_id, name

Asset: collection_id, file, caption, width/height optional

Tag: user_id, name unique per user

Favorites: (user_id, asset_id) unique



---

Key pages (MVP)

/ dashboard: recent assets + collections

/collections/ list/create

/collections/<id>/ browse assets with filters

/assets/<id>/ detail (tag edit, favorite)

/search/ q + tag + collection filters



---

Must-have admin

Django admin enabled for Assets/Collections/Tags

Bulk tag assignment for selected assets (admin action)



---

Neon specifics

Use Postgres indexes:

Asset(collection, created_at)

Tag(user, name)

favorites unique constraint




---

Smoke tests

1. Create user, login


2. Create collection


3. Upload 10 images


4. Tag 3 images “blueprint”


5. Filter by tag and collection


6. Favorite an image; favorites page shows it




---

Done definition

Done = authenticated gallery works end-to-end with collections/tags/filtering and stores metadata in Neon reliably.
