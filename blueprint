Hugo ReleaseGallery — static release notes + artifact manifests + “download vault”

What it is

A Hugo site that acts as a release vault: each release page shows changelog, links to artifacts, screenshots, and a generated manifest. Perfect for your “deploy zips,” “materials zips,” “backend zips,” etc.

Not a portfolio. A release system.
