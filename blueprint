ClipForge — desktop clipboard pipeline + smart transforms (operator-grade)

What it is

ClipForge is a desktop app that sits quietly in the background and lets you build clipboard workflows: take whatever you copied, run it through transforms (cleanup, format, wrap, template), and paste the improved version instantly.

This is not “logging small things.”
This is a productivity weapon—especially for your Codex prompts, patch blocks, manifests, SQL chunks, README sections, etc.

Why Tauri fits perfectly

Global hotkeys

Tray app

Clipboard access

Local-only privacy

Fast, tiny footprint



---

Core capabilities (MVP)

1) Clipboard history (short)

Store last N clipboard entries (default 50)

Search history

Pin important entries


Rule: no noisy telemetry; history stays local.


---

2) Transform pipelines

A “pipeline” is a named sequence of transforms:

Example pipelines:

Codex Blocker

wrap selection in fenced code block

add FILE_START / FILE_END markers

normalize line endings


Patch Standardizer

format into:

TARGET FILE:

FIND:

REPLACE WITH:



JSON Pretty + Safe

pretty print JSON

validate JSON


Slug + Title Kit

generate slug from title

generate kebab/snake/camel variants




---

3) Quick apply via hotkeys

Ctrl+Shift+1 applies Pipeline #1 to current clipboard

Ctrl+Shift+2 applies Pipeline #2

etc.


Also:

tray menu: pick pipeline and apply



---

4) Output preview

Before overwriting clipboard:

show “before / after”

confirm Apply



---

Storage (local SQLite)

Tables:

clipboard_items

id

content (text)

content_hash

created_at

pinned (bool)


pipelines

id

name

steps_json (array of step configs)

hotkey (optional)


pipeline_runs

id

pipeline_id

input_hash

output_hash

created_at


Privacy rule: all local only.


---

Transform step schema (stable)

Each pipeline step is:

{
  "type": "wrap_code_fence",
  "params": { "language": "text" }
}

Supported step types (MVP set):

trim_edges

normalize_newlines

wrap_code_fence

prepend_text

append_text

replace_regex (careful + capped)

json_pretty (validate + pretty print)

add_file_markers (FILE_START/FILE_END with filename input)

patch_standard_block (TARGET/FIND/REPLACE)



---

App architecture

Frontend (web UI inside Tauri)

Svelte (clean + fast) or Solid

3 pages:

History

Pipelines

Settings



Rust backend responsibilities

Clipboard read/write

Global hotkeys

SQLite persistence

Step runner engine (applies transforms)

Tray integration



---

UI layout (MVP)

History page

list: recent clipboard items

search bar

click item → preview panel

“Apply pipeline” dropdown


Pipelines page

list pipelines

create pipeline (add steps)

assign hotkey

test pipeline (preview)


Settings

max history size

confirm-before-overwrite toggle

startup at boot toggle (optional)



---

Guardrails (so it doesn’t get annoying)

Max clipboard item length (e.g., 200k chars)

Ignore duplicate clipboard events by content_hash

Rate limit clipboard polling (if using polling) or use event hooks if available

Regex step has:

max pattern length

timeout/cap on replacements

“preview required” if pattern is risky




---

Smoke tests

1. Copy text


2. App shows it in history


3. Run “Patch Standardizer” → clipboard updated


4. Paste → formatted correctly


5. Restart app → pipelines persist




---

Done definition

Done = ClipForge can capture clipboard history, run named transform pipelines with hotkeys, preview changes, and safely update clipboard—fully local.
