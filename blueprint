Blueprint Library — Django + Neon blueprint (structured knowledge + cross-reference graph)

What it is

Blueprint Library is a structured knowledge system for storing long-form entries, linking them together, tagging them, and browsing relationships. It’s not a note app — it’s a knowledge graph you can navigate. Think operator manuals, build blueprints, process docs, or conceptual frameworks.

This showcases Django strengths: relational modeling, search, graph relationships, and admin tooling.


---

Shared backbone (required in every Neon-backed Django app)

Flow: Browser → Django app → Neon Postgres

Identity

Django authentication (email/password)

All content scoped to user ownership


Server invariants

Django pinned version

ORM only (no raw SQL unless needed)

Env-based secrets only

No unnecessary logging or telemetry



---

Stack

Django

Neon Postgres

Markdown rendering (optional but recommended)

Full-text search using Postgres



---

Core concepts

This app stores Blueprint Entries that can:

• link to other entries
• belong to categories
• be tagged
• contain structured sections
• be navigated as a graph


---

Data model

BlueprintEntry

user (FK)

title

slug

summary

body (markdown/text)

created_at

updated_at


Category

user

name


Tag

user

name


EntryLink (graph edges)

from_entry

to_entry

relationship_type (e.g., “depends_on”, “expands”, “example_of”)


EntrySection (optional but powerful)

entry

heading

content

order



---

Postgres enhancements (Neon)

GIN index for search

trigram index for fuzzy title search (optional)


Indexes:

(user, slug) unique

GIN on body + summary

(from_entry, to_entry) index



---

Key pages (MVP)

Dashboard

recent entries

recently linked items

quick create


Entry Detail

rendered markdown

related entries

backlinks

tags & categories


Graph Navigation

“related entries” sidebar

backlink list

relationship type display


Search

full text search

filter by tag/category



---

Admin features (must include)

bulk tag editing

relationship creation tool

entry merge tool (optional later)



---

Relationship examples

This is where the app shines:

“LineFlow depends_on Timer Engine”

“QueueGauge expands Job Leasing”

“Atlas Gallery example_of Asset Pipeline”



---

Performance considerations

Prefetch related links

Limit backlink display to 25

Paginate search results



---

Smoke tests

1. Create entry “Timer Engine”


2. Create entry “LineFlow Board”


3. Link LineFlow → Timer Engine (depends_on)


4. Entry page shows related links


5. Backlink shows on Timer Engine page


6. Search returns entries




---

Why this is strong portfolio material

knowledge graph modeling

relational design beyond CRUD

cross-reference navigation

search & indexing

scalable documentation system



---

Done definition

Done = entries can be created, linked, searched, and navigated as a graph with ownership boundaries enforced and Neon providing fast relational queries.
