Eleventy Switchboard — 11ty static “link router” with rules + build-time validation

What it is

Eleventy Switchboard is a static site that acts like a smart router / directory: you maintain a single source file of “targets” (links, apps, docs, repos, endpoints), and Eleventy generates:

a clean browsable directory

tag/category pages

a fast search index

and—most importantly—a build-time validator that fails the build if anything is broken (missing fields, duplicate slugs, invalid URLs, orphan tags, etc.)


This is not a blog. It’s a static control panel with correctness guarantees.


---

Stack (boring + stable)

Eleventy (11ty) pinned

Node 20 compatible

No backend required

Minimal dependencies (only what’s necessary for search index generation)



---

Inputs (single source of truth)

src/data/targets.json (or .js returning an array)

Each target:

{
  "slug": "micro-exhibits",
  "title": "Micro-Exhibits: Digital Science Museum",
  "kind": "app",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "tags": ["museum","astro","neon"],
  "summary": "Fast catalog with halls/exhibits and favorites."
}

Required fields

slug (unique)

title

kind (enum: app|repo|doc|endpoint|tool|misc)

summary (non-empty)

tags[] (non-empty)

url (must be valid absolute URL)



---

Generated pages

/ Home (search + latest + quick filters)

/all Full directory list

/tags/:tag/

/kinds/:kind/

/t/:slug/ detail page per target



---

Build-time validation (the killer feature)

During build:

fail if duplicate slug

fail if missing required field

fail if invalid URL format

fail if tags empty

fail if summary empty

emit a report.json listing:

totals by kind/tag

warnings (if any)



Rule: if anything is “hard invalid,” the build exits non-zero.


---

Search

Build-time output: /_index.json containing only:

slug

title

summary

tags

kind

url


Client-side search (tiny JS):

filter + highlight

URL params persist search state

Smoke tests

1. Add 5 targets → build passes, pages generated


2. Add duplicate slug → build fails with clear error


3. Add invalid URL → build fails


4. Search works and uses only the index JSON


5. Tag pages list correct targets

Done definition

Done = Eleventy generates a fast directory + search from one data file, and the build fails loudly if data integrity is broken.
