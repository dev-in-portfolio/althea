Hugo AtlasShelf — static catalog generator (ingest JSON → pages) + faceted browsing

What it is

A Hugo site that ingests a big JSON dataset and generates a browsable catalog with filters and detail pages. Think: exhibit catalog, facility directory, tools index, API catalog—anything.

This is static data product building.

Core features (Hugo)

Input: data/items.json (or multiple JSON files)

Hugo generates:

/items list page

/items/<slug> detail pages

tag pages

category pages


Build-time index JSON:

title

category

tags

summary

slug


Client-side filtering (no backend) with URL params



---

Content contract (JSON)

Each item requires:

slug

title

summary

tags[]

category

optional images[]



---

Performance strategy

Pagination on list pages

Lightweight search index (no bodies)

Detail pages hold full bodies/images



---

Smoke tests

1. Drop in 200 items JSON


2. Build generates pages


3. Filter by category/tag works


4. Search works without loading full bodies


5. Pages link correctly
