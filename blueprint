Hugo FieldManual — static ops handbook + fast search + versioned playbooks

What it is

A Hugo site that acts as a versioned operator handbook: playbooks, runbooks, checklists, incident notes, deploy steps, “known failure modes,” etc. It’s built to be navigated fast, searched instantly, and kept in Git forever.

This is not a blog. It’s a working manual.
