Electron Dockyard — Electron app blueprint (local multi-repo launcher + env switchboard)

What it is

Dockyard is a desktop “launchpad” for your local projects: pick a repo, pick an environment preset, then launch dev server / build / tests with one click. It also gives you a clean place to store per-repo commands, ports, and notes.

This is not RepoPilot (git cockpit) and not clipboard transforms and not a timeline. This is process orchestration.

Core capabilities (MVP)

1) Repo registry

Add repo by folder picker

Store:

name

path

framework tag (optional)

default commands:

dev

build

test

lint


expected port(s)



2) Environment presets

Define presets like:

local

neon-dev

neon-prod


Each preset stores env vars without secrets by default, and supports:

.env file selection per repo

“inject env overrides” per run


3) Launch controls

Per repo:

Start dev server

Stop dev server

Open browser to localhost:port

Tail logs (last N lines)

Copy command to clipboard


4) Guardrails

Detect if port already in use

Detect if node_modules missing → prompt to run install

Show process PID and exit status



---

Architecture

Electron main process

filesystem access

spawn processes (child_process.spawn)

manage running processes per repo

store config file


Renderer (UI)

React or plain TS (boring)

repo list + details panel

terminal log panel



---

Storage (local only)

~/.dockyard/config.json

{
  "repos": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "micro-exhibits",
      "path": "/path/to/repo",
      "commands": { "dev": "npm run dev", "build": "npm run build" },
      "ports": [3000],
      "envPresetBindings": { "local": ".env", "neon-dev": ".env.neon" }
    }
  ],
  "presets": [
    { "name": "local", "vars": { "NODE_ENV": "development" } }
  ]
}


---

UI layout (MVP)

Left: repo list

Middle: repo detail (commands + presets)

Bottom: log/console panel

Top-right: running status indicators



---

Smoke tests

1. Add a repo


2. Click “Start Dev” → process runs, logs stream


3. Stop → process exits cleanly


4. Switch preset → env injection works


5. Port in use → warning shown




---

Done definition

Done = you can register repos and reliably start/stop dev/build commands with logs and env presets from a single desktop app.
