RepoPilot — desktop Git cockpit (branch map + safe push/pull + “one command” buttons)

What it is

RepoPilot is a desktop app that points at one or more local repos and gives you a clean “pilot panel” for the stuff you keep needing in Termux:

see all branches (local + remote)

quick checkout

status/diff summary

commit + push with guardrails

pull/rebase helpers

copy-pasteable commands (so you can still live in terminal)


This is not logging. This is a Git operator dashboard.


---

Why Tauri fits perfectly

local filesystem access

spawn git commands

show results in a clean UI

still respects your terminal workflow (it generates commands, doesn’t hide them)



---

Core capabilities (MVP)

1) Repo discovery / selection

Add repo by selecting folder path

Store list of repos locally

Validate “is this a git repo?”



---

2) Branch map (the “I just want to see all branches” feature)

Show:

Local branches

Remote branches

Current branch highlighted

Last commit message + date per branch


Actions:

checkout branch

create branch

delete local branch (confirm)

“track remote branch” helper



---

3) Status + diff summary

git status --porcelain

show staged vs unstaged counts

list changed files

quick diff preview (first N lines)


Buttons:

stage all

unstage all

discard changes (confirm + irreversible gate)



---

4) Commit + push (safe)

commit message input

preflight checks:

on correct branch?

staged changes exist?


commit

push

show the exact commands executed



---

5) Command generator mode (Termux-friendly)

Every button also displays:

the raw git command(s) it ran

a “copy” button


So if you want “1 command and done,” RepoPilot can:

generate it

you run it in Termux

or let RepoPilot run it



---

Architecture

Frontend

Svelte or Solid inside Tauri Pages:

Repos

Branches

Status

History (optional)


Rust backend

Filesystem access to repo paths

Spawn git commands (git must exist on system)

Capture stdout/stderr

Return structured result to UI

Persist settings (repos list) to local SQLite or a config file



---

Storage (local)

Two options:

Option A: simple JSON config (boring)

~/.repopilot/config.json

repo paths

last opened repo

UI preferences


Option B: local SQLite (if you want history)

repos table

recent actions table

saved command macros


MVP recommendation: JSON config (fewer moving parts).


---

Safety / guardrails

destructive actions require confirm:

discard changes

delete branch


never auto-force-push

never auto-clean untracked without explicit selection

cap diff preview size



---

“One command” macros (killer feature)

You define a macro like:

Safe Save

git add -A

git commit -m "<msg>"

git push


Sync

git fetch --all --prune

git pull --rebase


Branch Snapshot

git branch -a

git log --oneline --decorate -n 30



Each macro shows:

combined command block

output preview



---

Smoke tests

1. Add a repo folder


2. Branch page shows local + remote branches


3. Checkout branch works


4. Modify file → Status page shows change


5. Stage all → commit → push works


6. Commands displayed match what ran




---

Done definition

Done = RepoPilot can list all branches (local+remote), show status, and help you safely commit/push with copyable commands—entirely local in a Tauri desktop app.
