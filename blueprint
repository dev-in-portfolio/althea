Operator Ledger — local-first activity + decisions tracker

What it is

Operator Ledger is a desktop command console + logbook for tracking decisions, actions, and outcomes across projects.

Not “tiny logs.”
This is operator thinking capture.

Think:

decisions made

experiments run

outcomes observed

lessons learned


You’ll actually use this.


---

Why Tauri fits perfectly

runs locally

instant launch

data stays private

filesystem access

zero browser dependency

tiny memory footprint



---

Core capabilities

1️⃣ Decision capture

Create entries:

Title

Project

Decision made

Why

Expected outcome

Confidence level

Tags



---

2️⃣ Outcome logging

Later attach:

What happened

Unexpected effects

Lessons learned

Would you repeat?



---

3️⃣ Timeline view

Chronological feed:

✔ decisions
✔ outcomes
✔ pivots

Filter by project or tag.


---

4️⃣ Insight extraction

Search:

“show decisions with low confidence”

“show experiments that failed”

“show pivots”



---

Tech architecture

Frontend

Choose:

SolidJS (fast, lightweight)

or Svelte (simple)


Backend (Rust via Tauri)

Handles:

file storage

indexing

search

export



---

Storage (local SQLite)

---

Rust responsibilities

SQLite access

search queries

export to JSON

backup/restore



---

UI layout

Left sidebar

Projects Tags Filters

Main panel

Timeline feed

Entry view

Decision → Outcome pairing


---

Power features (easy wins)

✔ quick entry hotkey
✔ export project history
✔ tag auto-suggestions
✔ offline-first reliability


---

Why this is portfolio gold

Because it demonstrates:

✔ desktop engineering
✔ local-first design
✔ SQLite integration
✔ Rust + web bridge
✔ real productivity utility
✔ system thinking

And it’s something only an operator would build.


---

Smoke test

create decision

attach outcome

filter by tag

export entries

restart app → data persists



---

Done definition

Done = you can capture decisions, attach outcomes, search insights, and persist everything locally with zero cloud dependency.
