title: "Apportionment paradox"
slug: "apportionment-paradox"
type: PARADOX
summary: "An apportionment paradox is a situation where an apportionment—a rule for dividing discrete objects according to some proportional relationship—produces results that violate notions of common sense or fairness. Certain quantities, like milk, can be divided in any proportion whatsoever; others, such as horses, cannot—only whole numbers will do."

axioms:
  - Assume the rules of the domain apply uniformly.
  - Assume the observer’s criteria remain fixed.
  - Assume classification boundaries stay consistent.
  - Assume the model describes the real case.
  - Assume repeated steps do not change the outcome.
  - Assume no hidden variables are introduced midstream.
contradictions:
  - Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions

## Overview
An apportionment paradox is a situation where an apportionment—a rule for dividing discrete objects according to some proportional relationship—produces results that violate notions of common sense or fairness. Certain quantities, like milk, can be divided in any proportion whatsoever; others, such as horses, cannot—only whole numbers will do.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
