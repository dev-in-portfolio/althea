summary: "In physics, in the area of quantum information theory, a Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state is an entangled quantum state that involves at least three subsystems (particle states, qubits, or qudits). Named for the three authors that first described this state, the GHZ state predicts outcomes from experiments that directly contradict predictions by every classical local hidden-variable theory."

## Overview
In physics, in the area of quantum information theory, a Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state is an entangled quantum state that involves at least three subsystems (particle states, qubits, or qudits). Named for the three authors that first described this state, the GHZ state predicts outcomes from experiments that directly contradict predictions by every classical local hidden-variable theory.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
