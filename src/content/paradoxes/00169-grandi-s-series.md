## Overview
In mathematics, the infinite series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ⋯ is a divergent series, meaning that the sequence of partial sums of the series does not converge. Although it is divergent, it can be manipulated to yield a number of mathematically interesting results.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
