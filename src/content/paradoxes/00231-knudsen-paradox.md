type: PARADOX
summary: "The Knudsen paradox has been observed in experiments of channel flow with varying channel width or equivalently different pressures. If the normalized mass flux through the channel is plotted over the Knudsen number based on the channel width a distinct minimum is observed around K n = 0.8 {\displaystyle Kn=0.8} ."

  - paradox
axioms:
  - Assume the rules of the domain apply uniformly.
  - Assume the observer’s criteria remain fixed.
  - Assume classification boundaries stay consistent.
  - Assume the model describes the real case.
  - Assume repeated steps do not change the outcome.
  - Assume no hidden variables are introduced midstream.
contradictions:
  - Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions
  - A global rule conflicts with a local judgment
  - A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise
  - Changing the framing reverses the outcome
  - Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step

  - Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
  - What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?

## Overview
The Knudsen paradox has been observed in experiments of channel flow with varying channel width or equivalently different pressures. If the normalized mass flux through the channel is plotted over the Knudsen number based on the channel width a distinct minimum is observed around K n = 0.8 {\displaystyle Kn=0.8} .

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
