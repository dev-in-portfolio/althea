summary: 'In game theory, a Nash equilibrium is a situation where no player could gain more by changing their own strategy (holding all other players'' strategies fixed) in a game. A Nash equilibrium is the most commonly used solution concept for non-cooperative games.'

## Overview
In game theory, a Nash equilibrium is a situation where no player could gain more by changing their own strategy (holding all other players' strategies fixed) in a game. A Nash equilibrium is the most commonly used solution concept for non-cooperative games.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
