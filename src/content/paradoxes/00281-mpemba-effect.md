summary: 'The Mpemba effect is the observation that very hot liquids or colloids (such as ice cream) can freeze more quickly than colder ones, for similar volumes and surrounding conditions. Physicists remain divided on the effect''s reproducibility, precise definition, and underlying mechanisms.'

## Overview
The Mpemba effect is the observation that very hot liquids or colloids (such as ice cream) can freeze more quickly than colder ones, for similar volumes and surrounding conditions. Physicists remain divided on the effect's reproducibility, precise definition, and underlying mechanisms.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
