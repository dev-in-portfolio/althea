## Overview
Roger Gerhard Newton (né Neuweg; November 30, 1924 – April 14, 2018) was a German-born American physicist. Newton was born in Landsberg an der Warthe, Weimar Germany (present day Gorzów Wielkopolski) on November 30, 1924, to parents Margaret Blume and Arthur Newton, a dentist.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
