summary: "The private language argument is a family of considerations, developed by Ludwig Wittgenstein in Philosophical Investigations (PI), aiming to show that a language whose expressions are, in principle, understandable by only a single individual is unintelligible. In PI the idea is introduced at §243 and examined chiefly in §§244–271, with related remarks continuing to §315."

## Overview
The private language argument is a family of considerations, developed by Ludwig Wittgenstein in Philosophical Investigations (PI), aiming to show that a language whose expressions are, in principle, understandable by only a single individual is unintelligible. In PI the idea is introduced at §243 and examined chiefly in §§244–271, with related remarks continuing to §315.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
