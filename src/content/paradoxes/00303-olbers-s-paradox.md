summary: 'Olbers'' paradox, also known as the dark night paradox or Olbers and Cheseaux''s paradox, is a historical argument in astrophysics and physical cosmology that says the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the assumption of an infinite and eternal static universe.

## Overview
Olbers' paradox, also known as the dark night paradox or Olbers and Cheseaux's paradox, is a historical argument in astrophysics and physical cosmology that says the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the assumption of an infinite and eternal static universe. If the universe were static, homogeneous at a large scale, and populated by an infinite number of stars, any line of sight from Earth must end at the surf

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
