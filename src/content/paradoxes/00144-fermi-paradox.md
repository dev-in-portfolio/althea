title: "Fermi paradox"
slug: "fermi-paradox"
type: PARADOX
summary: "The Fermi paradox is the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparently high likelihood of its existence. The paradox is named after physicist Enrico Fermi, who informally posed the question—remembered by Emil Konopinski as 'But where is everybody?'—during a 1950 conversation at Los Alamos with colleagues Konopinski, Edward Teller, and Herbert York."

## Overview
The Fermi paradox is the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparently high likelihood of its existence. The paradox is named after physicist Enrico Fermi, who informally posed the question—remembered by Emil Konopinski as "But where is everybody?"—during a 1950 conversation at Los Alamos with colleagues Konopinski, Edward Teller, and Herbert York.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
