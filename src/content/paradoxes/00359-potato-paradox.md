slug: "potato-paradox"
type: PARADOX
summary: "The potato paradox is a mathematical calculation that has a result which seems counterintuitive to many people. The Universal Book of Mathematics states the problem as such: Fred brings home 100 kg of potatoes, which (being purely mathematical potatoes) consist of 99% water."

  - paradox
axioms:
  - Assume the rules of the domain apply uniformly.
  - Assume the observer’s criteria remain fixed.
  - Assume classification boundaries stay consistent.
  - Assume the model describes the real case.
  - Assume repeated steps do not change the outcome.
  - Assume no hidden variables are introduced midstream.
contradictions:
  - Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions
  - A global rule conflicts with a local judgment
  - A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise
  - Changing the framing reverses the outcome
  - Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step

prompts:
  - Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?

## Overview
The potato paradox is a mathematical calculation that has a result which seems counterintuitive to many people. The Universal Book of Mathematics states the problem as such: Fred brings home 100 kg of potatoes, which (being purely mathematical potatoes) consist of 99% water.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
