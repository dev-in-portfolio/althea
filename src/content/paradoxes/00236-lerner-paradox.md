title: "Lerner paradox"
slug: "lerner-paradox"
type: PARADOX
summary: "In economics, the Lerner paradox is the theoretical possibility that imposing tariffs raises the world price of the import good, causing a deterioration of the tariff-imposing country's terms of trade. Abba Lerner showed the possibility in his 1936 article."

## Overview
In economics, the Lerner paradox is the theoretical possibility that imposing tariffs raises the world price of the import good, causing a deterioration of the tariff-imposing country's terms of trade. Abba Lerner showed the possibility in his 1936 article.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
