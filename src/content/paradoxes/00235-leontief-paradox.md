slug: "leontief-paradox"
type: PARADOX
summary: "In economics, the Leontief's paradox is that a country with a higher capital per worker has a lower capital/labor ratio in exports than in imports. This econometric finding was the result of Wassily W. Leontief's attempt to test the Heckscher–Ohlin theory ('H–O theory') empirically."

## Overview
In economics, the Leontief's paradox is that a country with a higher capital per worker has a lower capital/labor ratio in exports than in imports. This econometric finding was the result of Wassily W. Leontief's attempt to test the Heckscher–Ohlin theory ("H–O theory") empirically.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
