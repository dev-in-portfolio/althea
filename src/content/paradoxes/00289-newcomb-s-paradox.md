type: PARADOX
summary: 'In philosophy and mathematics, Newcomb''s problem, also known as Newcomb''s paradox, is a thought experiment involving a decision problem where a player must decide whether to take one or two boxes in conditions where a being, often called the ''predictor'', is able to predict his choices with near-certainty. Newcomb''s paradox was created by William Newcomb of the University of California''s Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.'

## Overview
In philosophy and mathematics, Newcomb's problem, also known as Newcomb's paradox, is a thought experiment involving a decision problem where a player must decide whether to take one or two boxes in conditions where a being, often called the "predictor", is able to predict his choices with near-certainty. Newcomb's paradox was created by William Newcomb of the University of California's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
