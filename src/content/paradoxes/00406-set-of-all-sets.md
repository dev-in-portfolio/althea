type: PARADOX
summary: "In set theory, a universal set is a set that contains all of the objects in the theory, including itself. In set theory as usually formulated, it can be proven in multiple ways that a universal set does not exist."

axioms:
  - Assume the rules of the domain apply uniformly.

## Overview
In set theory, a universal set is a set that contains all of the objects in the theory, including itself. In set theory as usually formulated, it can be proven in multiple ways that a universal set does not exist.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
