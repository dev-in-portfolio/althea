summary: "In physics, the observer effect is the disturbance of a system by the act of observation. This is often the result of utilising instruments that, by necessity, alter the state of what they measure in some manner."

## Overview
In physics, the observer effect is the disturbance of a system by the act of observation. This is often the result of utilising instruments that, by necessity, alter the state of what they measure in some manner.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
