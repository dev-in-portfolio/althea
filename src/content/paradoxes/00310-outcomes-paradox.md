## Overview
The outcomes paradox (otherwise known as the "better prognosis hypothesis") is the observation that patients with schizophrenia in developing countries benefit much more from therapy than those in developed countries. This is surprising because the reverse holds for most diseases: "the richer and more developed the country, the better the patient outcome." The outcomes paradox came to light in the 1960s due to cross-

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
