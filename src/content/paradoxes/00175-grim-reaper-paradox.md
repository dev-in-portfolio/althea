type: PARADOX
summary: 'In philosophy, the Grim Reaper paradox is a paradox involving an infinite sequence of Grim Reapers, each tasked with killing a person if no reaper has already killed them. The paradox raises questions about the possibility of continuous time and the infinite past (temporal finitism).'

## Overview
In philosophy, the Grim Reaper paradox is a paradox involving an infinite sequence of Grim Reapers, each tasked with killing a person if no reaper has already killed them. The paradox raises questions about the possibility of continuous time and the infinite past (temporal finitism).

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
