slug: "algol-paradox"
type: PARADOX
summary: "In stellar astronomy, the Algol paradox is a paradox situation when the two stars of a binary star system appear to act opposite their cycle towards death; one star is more advanced in its stellar evolution than the other despite that star being smaller (less massive) than the other. This paradox is observed when one smaller star has already exited its main sequence form and its larger partner has not."

## Overview
In stellar astronomy, the Algol paradox is a paradox situation when the two stars of a binary star system appear to act opposite their cycle towards death; one star is more advanced in its stellar evolution than the other despite that star being smaller (less massive) than the other. This paradox is observed when one smaller star has already exited its main sequence form and its larger partner has not.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
