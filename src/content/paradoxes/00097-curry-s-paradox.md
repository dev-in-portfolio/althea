type: PARADOX
summary: "Curry's paradox is a paradox in which an arbitrary claim F is proved from the mere existence of a sentence C that says of itself 'If C, then F'. The paradox requires only a few apparently-innocuous logical deduction rules."

## Overview
Curry's paradox is a paradox in which an arbitrary claim F is proved from the mere existence of a sentence C that says of itself "If C, then F". The paradox requires only a few apparently-innocuous logical deduction rules.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
