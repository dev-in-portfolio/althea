summary: "In mathematical set theory, Cantor's theorem is a fundamental result which states that, for any set A {\displaystyle A} , the set of all subsets of A , {\displaystyle A,} known as the power set of A , {\displaystyle A,} has a strictly greater cardinality than A {\displaystyle A} itself. For finite sets, Cantor's theorem can be seen to be true by simple enumeration of the number of subsets."

## Overview
In mathematical set theory, Cantor's theorem is a fundamental result which states that, for any set A {\displaystyle A} , the set of all subsets of A , {\displaystyle A,} known as the power set of A , {\displaystyle A,} has a strictly greater cardinality than A {\displaystyle A} itself. For finite sets, Cantor's theorem can be seen to be true by simple enumeration of the number of subsets.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
