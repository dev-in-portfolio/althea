summary: 'The Pinocchio paradox arises in the hypothetical situation when Pinocchio says ''My nose will grow'' and is a version of the liar paradox. The liar paradox is defined in philosophy and logic as the statement ''This sentence is false.'' Any attempts to assign a classical binary truth value to this statement lead to a contradiction, or paradox.'

## Overview
The Pinocchio paradox arises in the hypothetical situation when Pinocchio says "My nose will grow" and is a version of the liar paradox. The liar paradox is defined in philosophy and logic as the statement "This sentence is false." Any attempts to assign a classical binary truth value to this statement lead to a contradiction, or paradox.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
