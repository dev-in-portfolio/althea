  - paradox
axioms:
  - Assume the rules of the domain apply uniformly.
  - Assume the observer’s criteria remain fixed.
  - Assume classification boundaries stay consistent.
  - Assume the model describes the real case.
  - Assume repeated steps do not change the outcome.
  - Assume no hidden variables are introduced midstream.
contradictions:
  - Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions
  - A global rule conflicts with a local judgment
  - A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise
  - Changing the framing reverses the outcome
  - Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step

prompts:
  - Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
  - What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
  - Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?

## Overview
James Bond Stockdale (December 23, 1923 – July 5, 2005) was a U.S. Navy vice admiral, aviator, and Stoic philosopher who received the Medal of Honor in 1976 for his leadership as a POW for more than seven years during the Vietnam War. Stockdale was the most senior naval officer held captive in Hanoi, North Vietnam.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
