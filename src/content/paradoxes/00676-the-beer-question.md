## Overview
The beer question is a thought experiment in politics that attempts to measure authenticity and likability in politicians by asking or polling voters about which politicians they would prefer to drink beer with, as in, spending casual time "hanging out" with. The question has been discussed as far back as the 2000 United States presidential election, as well as in the context of fictional political works such as The 

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
