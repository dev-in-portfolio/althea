Begin with one slow breath and locate the feature named in this waypoint. Let it guide your attention for a few minutes without forcing any change.

Notice the smallest shift it creates in your pace or mood. If nothing changes, stay with the practice anyway; repetition builds the effect.

Try this: name the waypoint aloud, then take ten slow steps before moving on.

## Extended Walk

This waypoint is a tool with a grounded tone. Let it set a patient and grounded pace: the goal is not speed, but steadiness. Begin by standing where you can see a threshold, a curb, and a window. map the smallest details first, then widen your view. Anchor your attention on the way your hands rest and the softest nearby sound. Let that anchor be the thread you return to when your mind wanders.

Walk slowly for three minutes without deciding where you will end up. Keep the pace mild enough that your breathing can stay even. Count the first ten steps; then stop counting and listen for texture. If you notice urgency, soften your shoulders and shorten your stride. Let the route make itself as you move.

Pause near a boundary: the line where a wall meets light, where sidewalk meets street, or where a room turns into a corridor. At that boundary, take a silent inventory: what is within reach, what is just beyond reach, and what is behind you that you will not carry forward. Say the inventory once, in your head, using simple words.

Now choose a small motion that can be repeated without strain. It could be the pace of your feet, the cadence of your breath, or the way you turn your head at each corner. Repeat it for a dozen breaths. This repetition is the core of Wayfinder: a quiet ritual that turns movement into meaning.

If you meet a distraction—noise, traffic, messages—treat it as a marker rather than a mistake. Notice how the distraction changes your pace. Adjust back to the anchor you chose, then continue. The walk is not about perfection; it is about returning, again and again, to a steady path.

Hold What is beginning, and what is ending? as a background question. You do not need an answer. Let the question color the way you observe your surroundings. If an answer arrives, keep it brief, as if you are placing a small stone in your pocket.

When you are ready, pick a destination with a clear boundary: a doorway, a step, or a line of shadow. Approach it with the same pace you used at the start. Cross the boundary intentionally. You have completed the waypoint when you can name one thing that felt different after the crossing.

## Field Notes
- Start: one breath, one anchor, one pace.
- Middle: notice texture without naming too many details.
- End: name a single shift and let it stand.

## Exercises
1. Walk for 2 minutes. Stop. Walk for 2 minutes. Compare how the second walk feels.
2. On your next ten steps, move your attention from your feet to your horizon and back again.
3. Choose one surface—stone, metal, wood—and look for it three times along your path.
4. If you can, repeat this waypoint at a different time of day and observe what changes.

## Reflection Questions
- What was easiest to hold steady: pace, breath, or attention?
- What boundary did you cross that felt meaningful?
- If you repeated this tomorrow, what would you keep and what would you change?

## Variations
- Short form: do it all within 60 seconds at a doorway.
- Quiet form: remove the internal narration; just move and notice.
- Shared form: walk side by side and agree on the same pace without speaking.

## Closing
End where you began, or end where the path feels complete. Either is valid. The real marker is the moment you feel less hurried than before. Carry that moment forward as a small compass, not a rule.
