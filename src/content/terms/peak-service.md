definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Peak service' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Peak load', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Peak load"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Peak service' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm peak load is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Peak service' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong peak load practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Peak service' like peak load in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
