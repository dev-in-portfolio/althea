definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Manager touch' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Escalation support', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Manager touch' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm escalation support is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Manager touch' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong escalation support practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Manager touch' like escalation support in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
