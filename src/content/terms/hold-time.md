definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Hold time' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Time in queue', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Time in queue"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Hold time' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm time in queue is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Hold time' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong time in queue practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Hold time' like time in queue in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
