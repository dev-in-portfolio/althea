definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Service standard' represents a specific operational concept tied to management & metrics. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Quality benchmark', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Service standard' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm quality benchmark is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Service standard' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong quality benchmark practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Service standard' like quality benchmark in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
