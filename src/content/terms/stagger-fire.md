definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Stagger fire' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Load distribution', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Stagger fire' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm load distribution is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Stagger fire' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong load distribution practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Stagger fire' like load distribution in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
