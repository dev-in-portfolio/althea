definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Prime cost' represents a specific operational concept tied to management & metrics. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Core expense metric', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Prime cost' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm core expense metric is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Prime cost' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong core expense metric practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Prime cost' like core expense metric in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
