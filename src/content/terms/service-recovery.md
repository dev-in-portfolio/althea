definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Service recovery' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Experience recovery', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Service recovery' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm experience recovery is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Service recovery' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong experience recovery practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Service recovery' like experience recovery in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
