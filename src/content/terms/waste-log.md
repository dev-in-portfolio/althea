definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Waste log' represents a specific operational concept tied to inventory & data flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Loss tracking', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Waste log' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm loss tracking is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Waste log' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong loss tracking practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Waste log' like loss tracking in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
