definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Menu navigation' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Interface navigation', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Menu navigation' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm interface navigation is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Menu navigation' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong interface navigation practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Menu navigation' like interface navigation in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
