definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Dry storage' represents a specific operational concept tied to architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Static storage', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Dry storage' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm static storage is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Dry storage' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong static storage practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Dry storage' like static storage in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
