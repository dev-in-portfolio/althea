definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Getting crushed' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Sustained overload', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Sustained overload"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Getting crushed' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm sustained overload is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Getting crushed' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong sustained overload practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Getting crushed' like sustained overload in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
