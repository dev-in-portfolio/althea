definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Course pacing' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Progressive workflow pacing', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Course pacing' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm progressive workflow pacing is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Course pacing' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong progressive workflow pacing practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Course pacing' like progressive workflow pacing in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
