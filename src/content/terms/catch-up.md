definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Catch up' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Throughput recovery', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Catch up' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm throughput recovery is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Catch up' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong throughput recovery practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Catch up' like throughput recovery in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
