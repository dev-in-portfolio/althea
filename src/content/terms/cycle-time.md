definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Cycle time' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Execution duration', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Cycle time' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm execution duration is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Cycle time' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong execution duration practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Cycle time' like execution duration in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
