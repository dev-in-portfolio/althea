  - "Operational cost metric"
definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Labor cost' represents a specific operational concept tied to management & metrics. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Operational cost metric', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Labor cost' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm operational cost metric is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Labor cost' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong operational cost metric practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Labor cost' like operational cost metric in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
