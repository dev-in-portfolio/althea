definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Stagger seating' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Load balancing', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Stagger seating' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm load balancing is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Stagger seating' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong load balancing practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Stagger seating' like load balancing in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
