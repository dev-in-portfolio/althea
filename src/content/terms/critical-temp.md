definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Critical temp' represents a specific operational concept tied to safety & security. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Safety threshold', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Critical temp' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm safety threshold is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Critical temp' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong safety threshold practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Critical temp' like safety threshold in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
