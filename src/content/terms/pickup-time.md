definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Pickup time' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Delivery latency', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Delivery latency"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Pickup time' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm delivery latency is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Pickup time' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong delivery latency practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Pickup time' like delivery latency in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
