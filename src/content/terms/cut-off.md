definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Cut off' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Permission restriction', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Permission restriction"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Cut off' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm permission restriction is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Cut off' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong permission restriction practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Cut off' like permission restriction in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
