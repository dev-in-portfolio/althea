definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Catch the wave' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Adaptive scaling', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Catch the wave' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm adaptive scaling is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Catch the wave' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong adaptive scaling practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Catch the wave' like adaptive scaling in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
