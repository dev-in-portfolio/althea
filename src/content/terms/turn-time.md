  - "Throughput per cycle"
definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Turn time' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Throughput per cycle', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Throughput per cycle"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Turn time' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm throughput per cycle is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Turn time' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong throughput per cycle practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Turn time' like throughput per cycle in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
