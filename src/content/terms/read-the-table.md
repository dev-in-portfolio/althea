definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Read the table' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'User sentiment detection', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "User sentiment detection"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Read the table' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm user sentiment detection is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Read the table' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong user sentiment detection practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Read the table' like user sentiment detection in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
