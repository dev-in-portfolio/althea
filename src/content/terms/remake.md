It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Rebuild after failure', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Remake' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm rebuild after failure is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Remake' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong rebuild after failure practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Remake' like rebuild after failure in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
