definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Double seating' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Sudden load spike', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Double seating' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm sudden load spike is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Double seating' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong sudden load spike practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Double seating' like sudden load spike in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
