definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Split checks' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Multi-user billing', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Split checks' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm multi-user billing is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Split checks' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong multi-user billing practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Split checks' like multi-user billing in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
