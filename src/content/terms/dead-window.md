definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Dead window' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Idle state', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Dead window' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm idle state is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Dead window' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong idle state practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Dead window' like idle state in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
