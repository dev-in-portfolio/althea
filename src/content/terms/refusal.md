It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Access denial', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization.

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Refusal' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm access denial is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Refusal' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong access denial practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Refusal' like access denial in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
