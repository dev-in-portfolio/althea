It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Production pipeline', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization.

  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Line' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong production pipeline practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Line' like production pipeline in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
