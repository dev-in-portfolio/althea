  - "Cold storage state"
definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Cold hold' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Cold storage state', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Cold storage state"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Cold hold' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm cold storage state is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Cold hold' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong cold storage state practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Cold hold' like cold storage state in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
