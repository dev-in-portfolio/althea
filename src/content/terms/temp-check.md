definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Temp check' represents a specific operational concept tied to quality & reliability. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Health/safety check', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Temp check' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm health/safety check is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Temp check' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong health/safety check practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Temp check' like health/safety check in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
