definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Out of service' represents a specific operational concept tied to reliability & maintenance. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Component offline', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Out of service' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm component offline is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Out of service' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong component offline practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Out of service' like component offline in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
