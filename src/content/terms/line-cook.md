definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Line Cook' represents a specific operational concept tied to roles & structure. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'IC engineer', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Line Cook' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm ic engineer is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Line Cook' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong ic engineer practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Line Cook' like ic engineer in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
