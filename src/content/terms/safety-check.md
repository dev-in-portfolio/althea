definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Safety check' represents a specific operational concept tied to safety & security. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Risk inspection', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Safety check' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm risk inspection is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Safety check' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong risk inspection practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Safety check' like risk inspection in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
