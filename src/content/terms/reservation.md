definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Reservation' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Scheduled capacity allocation', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Scheduled capacity allocation"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Reservation' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm scheduled capacity allocation is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Reservation' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong scheduled capacity allocation practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Reservation' like scheduled capacity allocation in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
