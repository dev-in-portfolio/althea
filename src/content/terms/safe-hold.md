definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Safe hold' represents a specific operational concept tied to quality & reliability. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Quarantine state', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Safe hold' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm quarantine state is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Safe hold' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong quarantine state practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Safe hold' like quarantine state in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
