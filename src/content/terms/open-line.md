definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Open line' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Service availability', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Open line' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm service availability is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Open line' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong service availability practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Open line' like service availability in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
