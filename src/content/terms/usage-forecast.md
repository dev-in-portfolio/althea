definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Usage forecast' represents a specific operational concept tied to inventory & data flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Demand prediction', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Usage forecast' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm demand prediction is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Usage forecast' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong demand prediction practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Usage forecast' like demand prediction in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
