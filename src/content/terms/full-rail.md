definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Full rail' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Max capacity', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Full rail' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm max capacity is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Full rail' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong max capacity practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Full rail' like max capacity in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
