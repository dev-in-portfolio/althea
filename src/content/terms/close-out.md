definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Close out' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Session termination', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Session termination"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Close out' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm session termination is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Close out' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong session termination practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Close out' like session termination in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
