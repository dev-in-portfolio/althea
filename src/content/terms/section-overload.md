definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Section overload' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Shard overload', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Shard overload"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Section overload' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm shard overload is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Section overload' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong shard overload practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Section overload' like shard overload in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
