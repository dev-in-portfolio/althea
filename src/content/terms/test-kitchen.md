definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Test kitchen' represents a specific operational concept tied to product & monetization. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Experimental sandbox', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Test kitchen' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong experimental sandbox practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
