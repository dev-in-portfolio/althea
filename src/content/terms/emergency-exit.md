definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Emergency exit' represents a specific operational concept tied to safety & security. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Failover path', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Failover path"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Emergency exit' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm failover path is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Emergency exit' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong failover path practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Emergency exit' like failover path in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
