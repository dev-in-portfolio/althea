definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Working' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'In-progress state', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Working' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm in-progress state is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Working' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong in-progress state practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Working' like in-progress state in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
