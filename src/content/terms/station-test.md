  - "Competency gate"
definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Station test' represents a specific operational concept tied to training & enablement. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Competency gate', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Competency gate"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Station test' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm competency gate is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Station test' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong competency gate practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Station test' like competency gate in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
