definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Line check' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'System health check', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Line check' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm system health check is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Line check' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong system health check practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Line check' like system health check in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
