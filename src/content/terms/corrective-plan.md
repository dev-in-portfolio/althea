definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Corrective plan' represents a specific operational concept tied to safety & security. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Remediation protocol', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Corrective plan' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm remediation protocol is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Corrective plan' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong remediation protocol practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
