definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Full staff' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Full capacity mode', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Full capacity mode"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Full staff' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm full capacity mode is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Full staff' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong full capacity mode practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Full staff' like full capacity mode in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
