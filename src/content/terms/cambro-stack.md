definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Cambro stack' represents a specific operational concept tied to architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Packaged artifacts storage', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
