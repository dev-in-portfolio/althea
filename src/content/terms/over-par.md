  - "Surplus capacity"
definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Over par' represents a specific operational concept tied to inventory & data flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Surplus capacity', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Surplus capacity"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Over par' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm surplus capacity is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Over par' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong surplus capacity practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Over par' like surplus capacity in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
