definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Spec deviation' represents a specific operational concept tied to quality & reliability. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Contract/requirement drift', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Contract/requirement drift"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Spec deviation' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm contract/requirement drift is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Spec deviation' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong contract/requirement drift practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Spec deviation' like contract/requirement drift in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."

In a professional kitchen, 'Spec deviation' represents a specific operational concept tied to quality & reliability. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Contract/requirement drift', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable.
