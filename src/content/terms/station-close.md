definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Station close' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Service shutdown', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Station close' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm service shutdown is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Station close' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong service shutdown practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Station close' like service shutdown in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
