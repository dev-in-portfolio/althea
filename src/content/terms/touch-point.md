definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Touch point' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Integration checkpoint', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Touch point' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm integration checkpoint is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Touch point' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong integration checkpoint practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Touch point' like integration checkpoint in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
