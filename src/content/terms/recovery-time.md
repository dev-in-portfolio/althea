examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Recovery time' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm restoration time is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Recovery time' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong restoration time practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Recovery time' like restoration time in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
