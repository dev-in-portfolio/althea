definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Dead cycle' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Wasted compute cycle', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Dead cycle' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm wasted compute cycle is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Dead cycle' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong wasted compute cycle practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Dead cycle' like wasted compute cycle in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."

In a professional kitchen, 'Dead cycle' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Wasted compute cycle', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable.
