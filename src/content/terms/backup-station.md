definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Backup station' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Failover system', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Failover system"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Backup station' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm failover system is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Backup station' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong failover system practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Backup station' like failover system in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
