definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Pull time' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Demand-triggered execution', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Demand-triggered execution"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Pull time' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm demand-triggered execution is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Pull time' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong demand-triggered execution practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Pull time' like demand-triggered execution in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."

In a professional kitchen, 'Pull time' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Demand-triggered execution', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable.
