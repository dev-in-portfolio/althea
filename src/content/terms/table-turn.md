definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Table turn' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Cycle completion', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Table turn' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm cycle completion is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Table turn' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong cycle completion practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Table turn' like cycle completion in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
