It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Schedulers', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization.

  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Timers' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong schedulers practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
