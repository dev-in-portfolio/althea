definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Close line' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Service offline', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Close line' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm service offline is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Close line' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong service offline practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Close line' like service offline in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
