definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Slow push' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Rate limiting', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Slow push' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm rate limiting is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Slow push' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong rate limiting practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Slow push' like rate limiting in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
