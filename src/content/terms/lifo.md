definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'LIFO' represents a specific operational concept tied to inventory & data flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Stack discipline', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Stack discipline"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'LIFO' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm stack discipline is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'LIFO' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong stack discipline practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'LIFO' like stack discipline in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
