definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Lull' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Low-load period', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Low-load period"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Lull' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm low-load period is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Lull' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong low-load period practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Lull' like low-load period in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
