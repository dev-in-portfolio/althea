definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Drills' represents a specific operational concept tied to training & enablement. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Incident rehearsal/load test', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Incident rehearsal/load test"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Drills' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm incident rehearsal/load test is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Drills' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong incident rehearsal/load test practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Drills' like incident rehearsal/load test in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
