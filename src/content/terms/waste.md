definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Waste' represents a specific operational concept tied to inventory & data flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Inefficiency loss', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Inefficiency loss"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Waste' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm inefficiency loss is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Waste' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong inefficiency loss practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Waste' like inefficiency loss in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
