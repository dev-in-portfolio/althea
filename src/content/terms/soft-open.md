definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Soft open' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Staged rollout', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Soft open' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm staged rollout is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Soft open' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong staged rollout practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Soft open' like staged rollout in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
