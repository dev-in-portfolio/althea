definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Lag time' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Delay overhead', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Lag time' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm delay overhead is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Lag time' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong delay overhead practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Lag time' like delay overhead in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
