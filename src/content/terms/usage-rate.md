definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Usage rate' represents a specific operational concept tied to inventory & data flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Consumption rate', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Usage rate' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm consumption rate is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Usage rate' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong consumption rate practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Usage rate' like consumption rate in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
