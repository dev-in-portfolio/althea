  - "Product optimization"
definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Menu engineering' represents a specific operational concept tied to product & monetization. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Product optimization', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Product optimization"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Menu engineering' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm product optimization is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Menu engineering' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong product optimization practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Menu engineering' like product optimization in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
