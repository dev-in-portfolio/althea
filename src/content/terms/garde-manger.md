definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Garde manger' represents a specific operational concept tied to architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Cold subsystem', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Garde manger' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm cold subsystem is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Garde manger' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong cold subsystem practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Garde manger' like cold subsystem in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
