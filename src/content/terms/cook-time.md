definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Cook time' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Processing time', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Cook time' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm processing time is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Cook time' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong processing time practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Cook time' like processing time in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
