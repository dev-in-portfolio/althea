definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Recipe testing' represents a specific operational concept tied to training & enablement. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Experimental validation', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Recipe testing' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm experimental validation is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Recipe testing' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong experimental validation practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Recipe testing' like experimental validation in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
