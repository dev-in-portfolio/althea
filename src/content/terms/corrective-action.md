definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Corrective action' represents a specific operational concept tied to quality & reliability. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Remediation step', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Corrective action' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm remediation step is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Corrective action' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong remediation step practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Corrective action' like remediation step in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
