examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Echo back' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm confirmation signal is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Echo back' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong confirmation signal practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
