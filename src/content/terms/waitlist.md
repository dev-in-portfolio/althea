definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Waitlist' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Overflow queue', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Overflow queue"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Waitlist' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm overflow queue is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Waitlist' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong overflow queue practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Waitlist' like overflow queue in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
