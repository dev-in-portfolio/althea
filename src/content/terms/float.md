It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Shared resource pool', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Float' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong shared resource pool practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
