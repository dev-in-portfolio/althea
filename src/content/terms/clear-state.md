It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Remove state', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Clear state' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm remove state is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Clear state' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong remove state practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Clear state' like remove state in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
