definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Inventory variance' represents a specific operational concept tied to inventory & data flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Data discrepancy', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Inventory variance' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm data discrepancy is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Inventory variance' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong data discrepancy practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Inventory variance' like data discrepancy in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
