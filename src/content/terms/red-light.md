definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Red light' represents a specific operational concept tied to communication & signaling. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Halt signal', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Halt signal"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Red light' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm halt signal is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Red light' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong halt signal practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Red light' like halt signal in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
