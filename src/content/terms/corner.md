It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Collision warning', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Corner' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm collision warning is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Corner' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong collision warning practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Corner' like collision warning in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
