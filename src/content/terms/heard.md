examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Heard' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm acknowledgment is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Heard' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong acknowledgment practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Heard' like acknowledgment in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
