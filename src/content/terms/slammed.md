definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Slammed' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Overload condition', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Overload condition"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Slammed' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm overload condition is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Slammed' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong overload condition practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Slammed' like overload condition in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
