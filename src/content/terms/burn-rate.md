definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Burn rate' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Capacity consumption rate', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Capacity consumption rate"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Burn rate' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm capacity consumption rate is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Burn rate' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong capacity consumption rate practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Burn rate' like capacity consumption rate in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
