techEquivalent:
  - "User-perceived latency"
definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Wait time' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'User-perceived latency', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "User-perceived latency"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Wait time' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm user-perceived latency is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Wait time' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong user-perceived latency practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Wait time' like user-perceived latency in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
