It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Intake process', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Receiving' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm intake process is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Receiving' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong intake process practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Receiving' like intake process in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
