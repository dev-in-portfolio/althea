definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Temp log' represents a specific operational concept tied to quality & reliability. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Monitoring log', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Temp log' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm monitoring log is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Temp log' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong monitoring log practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Temp log' like monitoring log in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
