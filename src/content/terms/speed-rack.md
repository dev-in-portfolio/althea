It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Staging buffer', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Speed rack' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm staging buffer is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Speed rack' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong staging buffer practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Speed rack' like staging buffer in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
