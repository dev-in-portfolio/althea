definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Limited menu' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'MVP release', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "MVP release"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Limited menu' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm mvp release is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Limited menu' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong mvp release practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Limited menu' like mvp release in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
