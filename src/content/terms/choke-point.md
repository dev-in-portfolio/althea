definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Choke point' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Hard constraint point', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Choke point' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm hard constraint point is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Choke point' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong hard constraint point practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Choke point' like hard constraint point in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
