definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Danger zone' represents a specific operational concept tied to safety & security. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Unsafe operating range', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Danger zone' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm unsafe operating range is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Danger zone' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong unsafe operating range practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Danger zone' like unsafe operating range in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
