definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Run hot' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'High utilization', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Run hot' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm high utilization is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Run hot' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong high utilization practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Run hot' like high utilization in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
