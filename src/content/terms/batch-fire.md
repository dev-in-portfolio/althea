  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Batch fire' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong parallel execution practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Batch fire' like parallel execution in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
