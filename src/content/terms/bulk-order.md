It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Large provisioning', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Bulk order' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm large provisioning is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Bulk order' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong large provisioning practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
