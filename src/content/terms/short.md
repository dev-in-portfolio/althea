It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Insufficient resources', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization.

  - "Think of 'Short' like insufficient resources in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
