definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Station setup' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Service initialization', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Station setup' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm service initialization is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Station setup' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong service initialization practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Station setup' like service initialization in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
