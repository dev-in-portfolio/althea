definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Turn & burn' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Rapid throughput', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Turn & burn' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm rapid throughput is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Turn & burn' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong rapid throughput practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
