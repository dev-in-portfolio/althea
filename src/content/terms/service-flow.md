definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Service flow' represents a specific operational concept tied to ux & service flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'User journey flow', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "User journey flow"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Service flow' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm user journey flow is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Service flow' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong user journey flow practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Service flow' like user journey flow in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
