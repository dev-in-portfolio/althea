  - "Minimal resources mode"
definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Skeleton crew' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Minimal resources mode', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Minimal resources mode"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Skeleton crew' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm minimal resources mode is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Skeleton crew' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong minimal resources mode practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Skeleton crew' like minimal resources mode in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
