definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Under par' represents a specific operational concept tied to inventory & data flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Shortage state', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Under par' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm shortage state is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Under par' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong shortage state practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Under par' like shortage state in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
