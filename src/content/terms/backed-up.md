definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Backed up' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Queue congestion', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Queue congestion"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Backed up' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm queue congestion is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Backed up' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong queue congestion practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Backed up' like queue congestion in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
