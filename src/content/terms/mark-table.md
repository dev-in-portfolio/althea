It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Tag session', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

  - "Think of 'Mark table' like tag session in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
