  - "Data corruption/decay"
definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Spoilage' represents a specific operational concept tied to inventory & data flow. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Data corruption/decay', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Data corruption/decay"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Spoilage' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm data corruption/decay is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Spoilage' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong data corruption/decay practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Spoilage' like data corruption/decay in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
