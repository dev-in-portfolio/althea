definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Critical control point' represents a specific operational concept tied to quality & reliability. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Risk checkpoint', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Critical control point' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong risk checkpoint practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
