definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Immersion circulator' represents a specific operational concept tied to tools & tooling. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Specialized compute tool', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Immersion circulator' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm specialized compute tool is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Immersion circulator' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong specialized compute tool practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Immersion circulator' like specialized compute tool in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
