definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Slow roll' represents a specific operational concept tied to workflow & execution. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Gradual rollout', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Slow roll' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm gradual rollout is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Slow roll' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong gradual rollout practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Slow roll' like gradual rollout in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
