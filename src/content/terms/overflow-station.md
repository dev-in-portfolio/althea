definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Overflow station' represents a specific operational concept tied to architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Burst capacity lane', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Overflow station' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm burst capacity lane is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Overflow station' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong burst capacity lane practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Overflow station' like burst capacity lane in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
