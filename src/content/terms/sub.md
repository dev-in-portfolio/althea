examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Sub' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm fallback dependency is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Sub' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong fallback dependency practices allow systems to scale smoothly."

  - "Think of 'Sub' like fallback dependency in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"

In technology environments, this maps to 'Fallback dependency', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable.
