definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Time/Temp control' represents a specific operational concept tied to safety & compliance. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Operating constraints', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Time/Temp control' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm operating constraints is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Time/Temp control' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong operating constraints practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Time/Temp control' like operating constraints in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."

In a professional kitchen, 'Time/Temp control' represents a specific operational concept tied to safety & compliance. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Operating constraints', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable.
