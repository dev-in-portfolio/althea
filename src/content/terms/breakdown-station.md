definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Breakdown station' represents a specific operational concept tied to system architecture & stations. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Service teardown', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Breakdown station' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm service teardown is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Breakdown station' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong service teardown practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Breakdown station' like service teardown in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
