definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Log sheet' represents a specific operational concept tied to quality & reliability. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Monitoring logs', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Log sheet' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm monitoring logs is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Log sheet' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong monitoring logs practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Log sheet' like monitoring logs in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
