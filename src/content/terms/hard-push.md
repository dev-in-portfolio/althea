definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Hard push' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Throughput surge', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Hard push' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm throughput surge is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Hard push' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong throughput surge practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Hard push' like throughput surge in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
