definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Green light' represents a specific operational concept tied to communication & signaling. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Go signal', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Go signal"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Green light' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm go signal is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Green light' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong go signal practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Green light' like go signal in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
