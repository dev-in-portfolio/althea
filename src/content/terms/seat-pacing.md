definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Seat pacing' represents a specific operational concept tied to performance & throughput. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Traffic throttling', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."
definitionTech: "Traffic throttling"
examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Seat pacing' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm traffic throttling is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Seat pacing' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong traffic throttling practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Seat pacing' like traffic throttling in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
