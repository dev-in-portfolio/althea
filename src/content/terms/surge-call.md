definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Surge call' represents a specific operational concept tied to communication & signaling. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Surge response', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Surge call' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm surge response is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Surge call' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong surge response practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Surge call' like surge response in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
