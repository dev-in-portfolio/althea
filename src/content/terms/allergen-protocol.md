definitionRestaurant: "In a professional kitchen, 'Allergen protocol' represents a specific operational concept tied to safety & compliance. It reflects how teams coordinate work, manage resources, and maintain flow under real-time pressure. In technology environments, this maps to 'Hazard isolation protocol', highlighting similar principles of system reliability, workflow coordination, and performance optimization. Understanding this concept helps teams design processes that are resilient, efficient, and scalable."

examplesRestaurant:
  - "Kitchen: The team ensures 'Allergen protocol' is completed before service begins.\n"
  - "Tech Ops: Engineers confirm hazard isolation protocol is complete before deployment.\n"
  - "Failure Scenario: When 'Allergen protocol' is skipped, delays and errors cascade.\n"
  - "Scaling Scenario: Strong hazard isolation protocol practices allow systems to scale smoothly."
examplesTech:
  - "Think of 'Allergen protocol' like hazard isolation protocol in a distributed system — if it isn’t done correctly"
  - "downstream services fail"
  - "latency increases"
  - "and recovery becomes expensive."
