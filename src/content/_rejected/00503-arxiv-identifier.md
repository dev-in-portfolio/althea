summary: 'arXiv (pronounced as ''archive''—the X represents the Greek letter chi ⟨χ⟩) is an open-access repository of electronic preprints and postprints (known as e-prints) approved for posting after moderation, but not peer reviewed. It consists of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, electrical engineering, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, mathematical finance, and economics, '
tags:
  - statistics

axioms:
  - Assume the rules of the domain apply uniformly.
  - Assume the observer’s criteria remain fixed.
  - Assume classification boundaries stay consistent.
  - Assume the model describes the real case.
  - Assume repeated steps do not change the outcome.
  - Assume no hidden variables are introduced midstream.
contradictions:
  - Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions
  - A global rule conflicts with a local judgment
  - A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise
  - Changing the framing reverses the outcome
  - Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step

prompts:
  - Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
  - What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
  - Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
  - What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?

## Overview
arXiv (pronounced as "archive"—the X represents the Greek letter chi ⟨χ⟩) is an open-access repository of electronic preprints and postprints (known as e-prints) approved for posting after moderation, but not peer reviewed. It consists of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, electrical engineering, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, mathematical finance, and economics, 

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
