slug: '00476-vertical-horizontal-illusion-2'
type: PARADOX
summary: 'The vertical–horizontal illusion is the tendency for observers to overestimate the length of a vertical line relative to a horizontal line of the same length. This involves a bisecting component that causes the bisecting line to appear longer than the line that is bisected.'

## Overview
The vertical–horizontal illusion is the tendency for observers to overestimate the length of a vertical line relative to a horizontal line of the same length. This involves a bisecting component that causes the bisecting line to appear longer than the line that is bisected.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
