summary: 'When two fluid layers move relative to each other, a friction force develops between them and the slower layer acts to slow down the faster layer. This internal resistance to flow is described by the fluid property called viscosity, which reflects the internal stickiness of the fluid.'

## Overview
When two fluid layers move relative to each other, a friction force develops between them and the slower layer acts to slow down the faster layer. This internal resistance to flow is described by the fluid property called viscosity, which reflects the internal stickiness of the fluid.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
