## Overview
The Mandelbrot set () is a two-dimensional set that is defined in the complex plane as the complex numbers c {\displaystyle c} for which the function f c ( z ) = z 2 + c {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c} does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at z = 0 {\displaystyle z=0} , i.e., for which the sequence f c ( 0 ) {\displaystyle f_{c}(0)} , f c ( f c ( 0 ) ) {\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))} , etc., remains bo

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
