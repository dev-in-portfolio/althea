## Overview
In mathematical logic, a set ⁠ T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} ⁠ of logical formulae is deductively closed if it contains every formula ⁠ φ {\displaystyle \varphi } ⁠ that can be logically deduced from ⁠ T {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}} ⁠; formally, if ⁠ T ⊢ φ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}\vdash \varphi } ⁠ always implies ⁠ φ ∈ T {\displaystyle \varphi \in {\mathcal {T}}} ⁠. If ⁠ T {\displaystyle T} ⁠ is a set of fo

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
