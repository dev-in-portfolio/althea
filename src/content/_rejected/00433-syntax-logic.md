summary: 'In logic, syntax is an arrangement of well-structured entities in the formal languages or formal systems that express something.

## Overview
In logic, syntax is an arrangement of well-structured entities in the formal languages or formal systems that express something. Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing or transforming the symbols and words of a language, as contrasted with the semantics of a language, which is concerned with its meaning.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
