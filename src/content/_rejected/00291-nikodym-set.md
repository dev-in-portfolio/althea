## Overview
In mathematics, a Nikodym set is a subset of the unit square in R 2 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}} with complement of Lebesgue measure zero (i.e. with an area of 1), such that, given any point in the set, there is a straight line that only intersects the set at that point.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
