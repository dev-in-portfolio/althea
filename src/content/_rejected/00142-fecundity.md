summary: 'Fecundity is a descriptor of productivity that can be defined in multiple ways; including the capability to produce offspring. It may refer to the level of fertility of human, animal, and organic life as measured by the number of gametes (eggs), seed set, or asexual propagules.'

## Overview
Fecundity is a descriptor of productivity that can be defined in multiple ways; including the capability to produce offspring. It may refer to the level of fertility of human, animal, and organic life as measured by the number of gametes (eggs), seed set, or asexual propagules.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
