summary: 'Constrictive pericarditis is a condition characterized by decreased elasticity and an increased thickening of the pericardium. These changes reduce the ability of the heart to fill with blood and can lead to symptoms of heart failure.'

## Overview
Constrictive pericarditis is a condition characterized by decreased elasticity and an increased thickening of the pericardium. These changes reduce the ability of the heart to fill with blood and can lead to symptoms of heart failure.

## Tension
- Two reasonable lines of inference yield opposite conclusions.
- A global rule conflicts with a local judgment.
- A stable resolution appears to violate a starting premise.
- Changing the framing reverses the outcome.
- Intuition and formalism diverge at the same step.

## Why It Matters
This entry tests how a stable rule-set can yield unstable conclusions under certain assumptions.

## Prompts
- Which assumption is doing the most hidden work?
- What changes if you relax the smallest constraint?
- Does the paradox dissolve or relocate when reframed?
- What is conserved, and what is sacrificed?
