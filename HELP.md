# Help — SurfaceLab

## Overview
SurfaceLab is a SvelteKit-based application for analyzing and visualizing 'surface' layers of operational data.

## Features
- **Layer Analysis**: Visualize data as distinct surfaces to identify overlaps and gaps.
- **Svelte Reactivity**: Instant updates when switching between different data layers.
- **Server-Side Processing**: Secure handling of complex data layers via SvelteKit hooks.

## How to Use
1. Select the data layers you wish to analyze from the surface menu.
2. Use the visualizer to inspect the intersections and status of each layer.
3. Export your analysis for use in high-level operational reporting.
