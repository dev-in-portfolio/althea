# Help — SchemaPulse

## Overview
SchemaPulse is a Python application for monitoring the health of operational schemas, featuring signal-based audio processing.

## Features
- **Pulse Monitoring**: Real-time health checks for active data schemas.
- **Audio-Op Signal**: Uses audio processing to detect 'pulses' in signal data.
- **Integrity Audits**: Automated checks to ensure schemas remain in sync with production data.

## How to Use
1. Select a schema to monitor from the pulse dashboard.
2. View the live health metrics and audio signal output.
3. Receive alerts if a schema's 'pulse' drops below operational thresholds.
